## Product Requirements Document: Animated Personal Portfolio Website

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a personal portfolio website, built entirely with Next.js and without a database. The website should be highly animated, visually creative, and boast a modern UI/UX, adhering to a consistent color palette dominated by a dark/blackish background. The primary goal is to showcase the individual's skills and experience in a professional and engaging manner, enabling potential employers or clients to easily learn more about them and contact them directly via a contact form with email functionality.

**2. Product Specifications**

*   **Overall Aesthetic:**
    *   **Theme:**  Dark, visually striking, highly animated, modern UI/UX.
    *   **Color Palette:** Primarily dark/blackish background with complementary accent colors, ensuring visual harmony throughout the website. The color scheme should consistently tie all components together.
    *   **Animations:**  Subtle and creative animations should be incorporated throughout the site to enhance user engagement and visual appeal. Animations should be performant and not detract from the site's load time or usability. Consider using libraries like Framer Motion or GSAP for animation implementation.

*   **Components:**
    *   **Hero Section:**
        *   Visually captivating introduction to the individual.
        *   Include a professional headshot or relevant graphic.
        *   Clear headline stating the individual's profession/expertise.
        *   Brief introductory statement summarizing skills and experience.
        *   Potentially include a call-to-action (e.g., "View My Work", "Contact Me").

    *   **About Section:**
        *   Detailed description of the individual's background, skills, and experience.
        *   Focus on key accomplishments and strengths.
        *   Structured format for easy readability.

    *   **Tech Stack Section:**
        *   Visually appealing display of the technologies the individual is proficient in.
        *   Use of icons or logos to represent each technology.
        *   Consider a rating system (e.g., skill level) for each technology.

    *   **Experience Section:**
        *   Chronological or reverse-chronological listing of relevant work experience.
        *   For each experience entry, include:
            *   Job title
            *   Company name
            *   Dates of employment
            *   Brief description of responsibilities and accomplishments.
            *   Consider using a timeline or other visually engaging layout.

    *   **Projects Section:**
        *   Showcase of the individual's best projects.
        *   For each project, include:
            *   Project title
            *   Brief description of the project
            *   Visual representation (screenshot or video)
            *   Link to the live project (if available)
            *   List of technologies used
        *   Implement a filter or category system if the number of projects is large.

    *   **Contact Us Section:**
        *   Contact form with the following fields:
            *   Name (required)
            *   Email (required - validated)
            *   Subject (optional)
            *   Message (required)
        *   Implement logic to send the form data to the individual's email address (detailed below).
        *   Display the individual's email address and/or social media links as well.
        *   Provide a clear confirmation message after the form is submitted successfully.

*   **Contact Form Email Logic:**
    *   **Technology:** Utilize a serverless function (API route) within Next.js to handle the email sending process.
    *   **Mailing Library:**  Consider these free and easy-to-integrate options:
        *   **Nodemailer:** A Node.js module for sending emails.  Requires a configured email provider (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, Mailgun).  While Nodemailer is free, using a transactional email service like SendGrid or Mailgun might incur costs based on usage.
        *   **EmailJS:** A service that allows sending emails directly from the client-side without needing a backend server.  It has a free tier with limited usage. This option keeps the logic client side, so no api route would be needed, but it is less secure because the API keys are potentially visible.
    *   **Email Content:**
        *   Subject: "New Contact Form Submission from [Portfolio Website]"
        *   Body: Include all the data submitted in the form (Name, Email, Subject, Message).

*   **Responsiveness:**
    *   The website must be fully responsive and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices).

*   **Performance:**
    *   Optimize the website for fast loading times.
    *   Minimize the use of large images or videos.
    *   Implement lazy loading for images and videos.
    *   Optimize animations for performance.

*   **SEO:**
    *   Implement basic SEO best practices (e.g., meta descriptions, title tags, relevant keywords).

**3. User Experience**

*   **Navigation:**
    *   Intuitive and easy-to-use navigation menu.
    *   Navigation should be clear and consistent across all pages.
    *   Consider a fixed navigation bar for easy access to different sections.

*   **Interactions:**
    *   Animations and transitions should be smooth and responsive.
    *   Form validation should provide clear and helpful error messages.
    *   The website should be visually appealing and engaging.

*   **Accessibility:**
    *   Ensure the website is accessible to users with disabilities.
    *   Provide sufficient color contrast between text and background.
    *   Use semantic HTML for proper structure and accessibility.
    *   Add alt text to all images.

*   **Flow:**
    *   Users should be able to easily find the information they are looking for.
    *   The website should guide users through the individual's experience, skills, and projects in a logical and engaging manner.
    *   The contact form should be easily accessible and straightforward to use.

**4. Implementation Requirements**

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   Next.js (React framework for building server-rendered applications)
    *   HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+)
    *   Potentially Tailwind CSS or another CSS framework for styling.
    *   Animation library (Framer Motion, GSAP, etc.)
    *   Nodemailer (for email functionality) or EmailJS

*   **Development Environment:**
    *   Node.js and npm (or yarn)
    *   Code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
    *   Git for version control

*   **Deployment:**
    *   The website can be deployed to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify.  These platforms provide easy deployment and hosting for Next.js applications.

*   **Specific Implementation Notes:**
    *   **API Route for Contact Form:** Create a Next.js API route (e.g., `/pages/api/contact.js`) to handle the contact form submission and email sending logic.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information like email credentials (if using Nodemailer) in environment variables to avoid exposing them in the codebase.  Use `.env` file for local development and configure environment variables in the deployment platform.
    *   **Form Validation:** Implement client-side validation to ensure that required fields are filled and that the email address is in a valid format. Also implement server-side validation for security.
    *   **Animation Design:** Define a clear animation strategy and use consistent animation patterns throughout the website. Consider using CSS variables to control animation timings and properties.
